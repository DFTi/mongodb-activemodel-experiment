Gatekeeper (MongoDB Wrapper)
  * Manages Users
  * Manages User permissions to Models
  * Handles Authentication & Session
  * Checks permissions on incoming queries
  * Passes authorized queries to MongoDB
  * Relays authorized events to Client ORM

Live Model (Client ORM)
  * If relations are needed, client must add relational support
  * Queries MongoDB via Gatekeeper
    - GatekeeperModel#all(instance_callback) should return all gkm_instances
    - GatekeeperModel#where(query, instance_callback) should return gkm_instances that match the query
    - GatekeeperModel#find(ids, instance_callback) can take one or more ids and should return those gkm_instances
    - gkm_instance#save should send a save query to the gatekeeper with the new object attributes
    - gkm_instance#delete should send a delete query to the gatekeeper with the object id to delete
  * Create new instance
    - GatekeeperModel#new(json, callback) required on all instances to receive updates
                                callback(instance, verb) - used by the UI to update instance display
  * Maintains a callback stack
    gkm_instance#callbacks is an array of callbacks that are called for a new event
    gkm_instance#callbacks.push adds a new callback to the stack
    gkm_instance#callbacks.pop removes a callback from the stack


Next Steps:
    * Develop CLI version of example Gatekeeper Client
    * Run two instances of CLI version and behavior-drive the Gatekeeper
